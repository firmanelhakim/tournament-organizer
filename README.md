# üèÜ Tournament Mixer - Rotating Partner Round Robin Organizer
A simple, zero-dependency web application to automate the creation and management of "mixer" or "scramble" style round robin tournaments for social sports like pickleball, badminton, tennis, or paddle.
This tool eliminates the manual work of creating schedules, tracking scores, and calculating standings, allowing organizers to run a smooth, efficient, and enjoyable event for everyone.

## ‚ú® Key Features
 * Automated Schedule Generation: Creates a multi-round schedule using the "Split and Rotate" algorithm to ensure players have different partners and opponents.
 * Simple Setup: Just enter the number of players, courts, and a list of player names to get started.
 * Interactive Scoring: Easily enter scores for each match directly on the schedule.
 * Real-Time Leaderboard: The leaderboard updates instantly after each score submission.
 * Advanced Ranking: Players are ranked by Total Points, with automatic tie-breakers using Point Differential (Points For - Points Against).
 * Fully Self-Contained: Everything is in a single index.html file. No servers, no databases, no setup required.
 * Mobile-Friendly: The interface is responsive and works great on phones and tablets, making it perfect for on-the-go tournament management.

 * Customizable Rules: Allow the organizer to change the points awarded for a win or loss.
 * Persistent Data: Use browser localStorage to save the tournament state, so if the page is refreshed, the data isn't lost.
